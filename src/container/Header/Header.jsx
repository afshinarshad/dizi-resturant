        Â Welcome To Our Traditional Dizi Restaurant! We Are Proud To Offer Our
        Customers An Authentic Taste Of Iranian Cuisine, With A Focus On The
        Beloved Dish Of Dizi. Our Restaurant Is Built On A Foundation Of
        Quality, Community, And Sustainability.<br/>Dizi is a traditional Persian
        dish made with lamb, chickpeas, white beans, tomatoes, potatoes, and
        onions. The ingredients are slow-cooked in a clay pot called a dizi
        until they become tender and blend together to create a thick stew. Once
        cooked, the solid ingredients are mashed together with a pestle and
        served with the broth in individual bowls. It's often accompanied by
        flatbread and fresh herbs, and is a popular comfort food in Iran.
